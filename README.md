# Writeup

__Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.__

Proportial "P" (as the name suggests) compensates for the current error by providing negative feedback directly proportional to the current error only.

Proportional Control only cares about the current error and does not take into account the error at previous steps, so this results in oscillations about the reference trajectory. Using only the P controller we see that the vehicle oscillates and eventually jumps out of the track at turns in the [video](./vids/Pcontroller.mov)

Derivative "D" compensates for the change in error by providing negative feedback that is proportioal to the different in error from the previous step and the current step.

Derivative controller accounts for the change in error from the previous step. This way the controller has an understanding of how the error has been changing. As the current trajectory reaches the reference trajectory, the difference in error diminishes, and so does the effect of differential control. This leads to a steady state error, where the current trajectory ends up being "close to" the reference trajectory but doesn't converge. We can see the effect of Differential control in the [video](./vids/PD.mov) where the oscillations have decreased from P controller, but the vehicle is off center.

Integral "I" compensates for the total accumulated error over last steps by providing negative feedback proportional to the total error accumulated by the system so far. This helps reduce the steady state error. We see the effect of Integral control in the PID controller [video](./vids/final_params.mov)

__Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.__
The final parameters were chosen by hand-tuning. I modified `main.cpp` to accept command line arguments to I could avoide running `make` every time one of the parameters was tuned. This way I iteratively determined the final parameters. This is the first submission to pass the rubric. They can be tuned further by implementing twiddle, which I am going to attempt in the future. The PID controller could be used for throttle as well.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
